# README

This is the ["Object Oriented Programming"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks) project from the "The Odin Project" course.
Here I completed Ruby exercises by using Classes and their instances.

To run the exercises just clone the repository and run the '.rb' files by typing "ruby ****.rb" in the terminal.
